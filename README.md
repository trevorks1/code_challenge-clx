# Code Challenge

## Problem Task

Problem - Return 1 - 100 using node.js, then with every multiple of 3 return CLX and multiples of 5 returning DTC.
Then with multiples of 3 and 5 return CLXDTC

## Solution

Using a for loop I loop through every index out of 1-101 incrementing up.
Then conditional if and if else statements to apply a log of each return.

EXP:
1
2
CLX
4
DTC
CLX
7
8
CLX
DTC
11
CLX
13
14
CLXDTC
